# Affinity Map Description
This app allows the user to add a sticky note to the page, add whatever note you want to the sticky note, and then group that sticky note into whatever category you would like.

# Bugs
The categories are pre-set.
Using spaces in the notes causes bugs.
Once you create more that one stickynote the sticky notes become linked(the keys are not unique).
The components cannot be resized.
